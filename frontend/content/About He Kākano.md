# About He Kākano

## The Project

Understanding the full extent and breadth of human genomic variation in the Aotearoa population and its health consequences is essential for accurate diagnosis and the effective use of genomics in healthcare. He Kākano – the Aotearoa Māori  Variome Resource -  is a catalogue of genomic variation from over one thousand individuals with Māori ancestry from across Aotearoa. The creation, curation and ongoing safety of this resource is Māori-led, with co-development of the tikanga underlying the project with communities that have contributed to it.  Use of the data must be aligned with the aim of improving the health and welfare of whānau Māori and their communities. Access to these data is available to individuals who are engaged with the delivery of genomic medicine through a specific application process. The project was funded through Genomics Aotearoa, a platform of genomic science research funded by the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment.

## About the Dataset

Over 1000 individuals have participated in the formation of He Kākano. No participant has a severe, childhood-onset genetic condition. Participants were drawn from across Aotearoa and their DNA sequences were obtained from either a salivary sample (>98% of participants) or from venous blood. No samples have been biobanked for this project and no personal or health information is associated with the samples or data generated though genome sequencing. All samples used in the creation of the Variome dataset were anonymised before genome sequencing and once variants have been merged to form this dataset it is not be possible to identify the variants contributed by any given participant. No personal or identifiable community information is associated with the He Kākano dataset.

## Conditions of Use of the Variome Dataset

He Kākano is a resource of allele and genotype frequencies of single nucleotide and small insertion/deletion variants collected from the genomes of >1000 consented individuals from across Aotearoa New Zealand. These individuals consented for their aggregated genomic data to be used for the purposes of improving genomic diagnostics and/or genomic research that is ethically approved and aims to improve health outcomes for Māori.   The use of the data is permissioned to named applicants who must apply to the Leadership Roopu for access to this resource. The leadership roopu are a governing body for the use of these data and are responsible for its safety and integrity. 

Inherent to the creation of He Kākano is the sequencing of DNA. Embodied in this DNA is whakapapa (genealogy), a term that not only emphasises ancestral connections but extends beyond that to recognise the nature of relationships between diagnosticians, researchers, those that contributed to this resource and the communities they come from. The term embodies connections including genealogy, social and ecological relationships, cultural histories, family traits, and ancestral inheritances. Consequently, the data with which this resource is built embodies whakapapa. Therefore, the storage and use of these data for genetic/genomic diagnostics and for research becomes a culturally significant activity. 

## Principles Surrounding use of He Kākano data

The information and consent forms signed by participants contributing to this resource state:

1. The purpose of He Kākano is to support the clinical evaluation of individuals with Māori ancestry so that their healthcare is more precise and accurate.

2. No individualized or personally identifiable data will be revealed to users or administrators of the resource.

3. Those who gifted their data to the creation of He Kākano retain ownership of their personal genomic data and their DNA sample.

   **a)** For the purposes of this project “ownership” means that they can obtain or remove their genomic data and DNA sample from the project at any stage. However, this does not enable individuals to extract their data from the merged resource - that will not be possible, as explained in the information sheet.

   **b)** Any benefits emerging from the use of the merged resource data, the Māori Variome, will be managed by the Leadership Roopu on behalf of the participants.
