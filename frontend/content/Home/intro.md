**He Kākano** is a resource consisting of aggregated genomic data representing genetic variation present in the whole genome sequences of 1000 individuals with Māori ancestry. It was created with the express purpose of delivering healthcare benefits for Māori communities by facilitating and enabling genomic diagnostics and research. Its use and security are controlled by a Governance body consisting of experts in indigenous genomics drawn from across participating communities. Access and use of the resource is strictly by application through this Governance body.
