# Conditions of Use of the Variome Dataset

1. Access to the Variome Dataset is restricted and requires a registration step. This means that potential users need to request access before using the Variome Dataset. A specific application process needs to be followed before each user receives approval. **Personalised access permissions are not transferrable to others; each user must have their own account**.

2. Once a requesting user submits all the required information, the application will be reviewed by members of the Governance Rōpu (or their appointees) and approved or declined. Approval will be based on whether users need to access data in accordance with the Variome guidelines to assist in making diagnoses. 

3. Audit of activity and use of He Kākano is a mandatory component of use of the Variome. This is to preserve the integrity of the processes set up surrounding the use of the resource, to maintain accounts only in the hands of active users and to monitor the benefits provided by this resource.

4. Enquiries regarding becoming a user of He Kākano should in the first instance be directed to Professor Stephen Robertson email: stephen.robertson@otago.ac.nz


## Acknowledging the use of the resource

1. Any diagnostic report that uses Māori Variome data for diagnostic purposes should acknowledge the use of the resource in the report that is written for any relevant patient.

2. Two indicative forms of acknowledgement are:

*“He Kākano, The Aotearoa Māori Variome Resource version ### was consulted in the preparation of this report.  He Kākano is a genetic information database of a population of individuals with self-declared Māori ancestry. It aims to provide a more accurate representation of Māori genetic variation than larger global genetic databases. Any use of the data from He Kākano beyond that necessary for diagnostic purposes requires the approval of the He Kākano Leadership Rōpu. Our laboratory expresses gratitude to the Leadership Roopu for permission to use the data to assist with diagnosis of this individual.”*

*“In He Kākano (The Aotearoa Māori Variome Resource version ###), GENE:c.#### recorded a minor allele frequency of  XXXX enabling the ACMG population frequency evidence ### (typically BS2) to be applied.”*
