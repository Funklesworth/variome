# Applying to be a User of He Kākano

This Application Process is for those who will be accessing He Kākano for the purpose of making clinical diagnoses for patients. Use of the Māori Variome Dataset must be:

- consistent with the [CARE principles](https://www.gida-global.org/care)
- be aligned with the tenets of Indigenous Data Sovereignty and
- preserve and enhance the trust and enthusiasm of participating communities who have contributed to the creation of the resource.

Consequently, a process has been established whereby access to, and use of, this resource for the purpose of clinical diagnosis is by permission.

Users must:

1. Be registered professional medical laboratory scientists or clinicians engaged in the provision of genetic diagnostics.

2. Have read and understood the purpose of the Variome including the [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care) and [Māori Data Sovereignty Principles](https://www.temanararaunga.maori.nz/tutohinga)

3. Confirm that the purpose for their access is for clinical diagnosis, and that they will NOT use He Kākano data for research or publications under this approval.

4. Audit of activity. Users must understand that their activity and use of the Variome dataset will be monitored, and their use of the database will be periodically reviewed. The database has an in-built audit tool that records when and which data are accessed by each user. Patterns of use that are inconsistent with the guidelines outlined in this document, if detected, will result in accounts being suspended and appropriate professional disciplinary bodies notified resulting in possible sanctions and legal action. Such breaches can result in the rescinding of access to the Variome Dataset and the reporting of the behaviour to professional organisations, employers and/or communities.

Enquiries regarding becoming a user of He Kākano should in the first instance be directed to Professor Stephen Robertson: [stephen.robertson@otago.ac.nz](mailto:stephen.robertson@otago.ac.nz)
